# Lbry for Kodi

This is a [Kodi](https://www.kodi.tv) add-on for providing access to the [Lbry](https://lbry.com) network.

## Requirements

Lbry needs to be running for the add-on to be able to access it. This can be done either by [installing the Lbry client](https://lbry.com/get?showall=1) and letting it run in the background, or by running the Lbrynet daemon from [the Lbry SDK](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk). The add-on defaults to looking for Lbry at localhost, but this can be changed in the add-on settings.

## Installation

Download the zip from the Releases page or the Code button at the top of this page, then drag and drop the zip onto Kodi or [see the Kodi wiki for other installation methods](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files).

## Development

If you are installing the add-on for development, it is recommended that you install the add-on via Kodi before cloning the repo to the add-ons folder, as it prompts Kodi to install the necessary dependencies. Add-ons are installed at `%APPDATA%/Kodi/addons` on Windows, and [near the userdata](https://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata#Location_of_the_userdata_folder) on other platforms. [Kodi Addon Checker](https://pypi.org/project/kodi-addon-checker/) can be used to check for best practices.
